# CSI-280_PROJECT-OCTOPUS
---
An open-source arena battler, with you \[Ryan Buck\] and your friends \[also Ryan Buck\] alone against swarms of octopi and strangely familiar faces.

## Setup

1. Install Godot
https://godotengine.org/download
2. Clone the repo to any folder
```git clone https://github.com/AkivaNugent/CSI-280_PROJECT-OCTOPUS```
3. Launch Godot from where that was installed
4. In the launcher, hit "Import" on the top left and navigate to the outermost folder (called "CSI-280_PROJECT-OCTOPUS"), 
5. Hit "Select Current Folder" on the bottom right, then "Import & Edit" on the smaller window
6. If the smaller window says "Please choose a "project.godot", a directory with one, or a ".zip" file." and "Import & Edit" is greyed out, then hit "Browse" on the right and try the navigation again
7. On subsequent launches, the Godot launcher should remember the loaded project and it can just be double clicked in the launcher.
